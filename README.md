📊 Mobile Sales Data Interactive Dashboard – Power BI


🧩 Project Overview


This project is an Interactive Dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI to analyze Mobile Sales Data.

Using various DAX formulas, I have derived meaningful business insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) that help understand sales trends, product performance, and revenue distribution.

The dashboard visually represents crucial metrics through different charts, slicers, and visuals, enabling users to make data-driven decisions effectively.

📈 Dashboard Insights

The dashboard presents insights such as:

📅 Monthly and Quarterly Sales Trends

📱 Top Performing Mobile Brands and Models

💰 Total Sales Revenue and Profit Analysis

🌍 Sales Performance by Region / Country

👥 Customer Purchase Patterns and Preferences

🏷️ Comparison of Online vs Offline Sales Channels

Each insight is displayed using interactive charts like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, cards, and slicers, making data exploration easy and engaging.


⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used


👉🏻Microsoft Power BI – For data visualization and dashboard creation

👉🏻DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures and KPIs

👉🏻Microsoft Excel – For data storage and preprocessing


🧮 Key DAX Measures Used


Some of the DAX formulas used in this project include:


1️⃣Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])

2️⃣Total Quantity = SUM(Sales[Quantity])

3️⃣Profit = [Total Sales] - [Total Cost]

4️⃣Sales Growth % = DIVIDE(([Total Sales] - [Previous Month Sales]), [Previous Month Sales])

5️⃣Average Selling Price = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Quantity])

These measures were used to create insightful KPIs and dynamic visualizations.
