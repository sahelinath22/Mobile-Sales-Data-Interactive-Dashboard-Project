⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used


✅Microsoft Power BI – For creating visuals and insights

✅Microsoft Excel – For storing and preparing raw data

✅DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For creating calculated columns and measures


🧮 Key DAX Measures Used


Some examples of the DAX formulas used in this project:

👉🏻Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])

👉🏻Total Quantity = SUM(Sales[Quantity])

👉🏻Profit = [Total Sales] - [Total Cost]

👉🏻Average Sales Value = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Transactions])

👉🏻Sales Growth % = DIVIDE(([Current Month Sales] - [Previous Month Sales]), [Previous Month Sales])


These DAX calculations power the KPIs and trend visuals in the dashboard.
